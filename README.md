# Segmenation beef eye-muscle area

## Object

The eye-muscle area of beef is one of the important region for grading beef quality, such as marbling, intramuscular fat, and so on.
Therefore, it is necessary to segment the eye-muscle area from raw beef image in order to evaluate the beef quality efficiently. 

## Model & Code

our models were implemented by **tensorflow 2.3** and **keras**

#### Model summary
1. This model was based on U-Net architecture.
2. Predicted mask will be generated by model.
3. Model code can be found in the `model.py`.

## Installation 
The pre-trained weight must exist as `weights.h5` in the path where `main.py` is located. pre-trained weight can be downloaded at https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1vjub1IfaQV0IBKaPndtQeRV9fWvIvydx?usp=sharing. 

#### Example 
```
python main.py --img img --out example
```
All of beef images you want to segment must be in the img forder. You can make the predicted mask by running the above command.


## Model output

1. `Predicted mask`


2. `Painted image`

  
## Test results
Model was trained by 8,201 raw beef images,
and test set contain 2,045 images.
